info: Redesign of the Salsalella sauce, a typical product of Alella, Catalonia. The new packaging was done considering the limited resources of the manufacturer, and the bottle was not changed to avoid any substancial changes on the production, the box that comes with the bottle was created as a plus option to use it in retail stores.
