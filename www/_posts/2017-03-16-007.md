info: Sabadell's Town Hall asked to our class to develop a series of proposals for a renewal of the Branding of the museums of the City, The main point of the briefing that they gave us was to create an image that differentiated the three institutions but showing a unification point. My proposal was a use of three different fonts, related to the Museums' theme and the three faces of the isometric view of a cube.
