info: Opening credits for the film "The Truman Show", these give it a more gloomy feel and take the humor out of the movie. Letting just the feeling of being observed every single moment. This was a class assignment where no editing programs where allowed to be used with the exception of the music and cutting the scenes. Therefore, the titles and color editing had to be done 'manually' .
