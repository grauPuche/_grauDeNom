So this final project has been a major fail. This last 7 weeks have been hard on me, It's easy to understand the concepts but when trying to apply them to code, is verrryyy hard. I thought I understood JavaScript but I still got much to learn and I asure that this project once it's done, it will have its floating 'balls'.

My objective with this last assignment was to create de flocking behaviour within Phaser, and inside an already existing project.

Againg, as I said I do undestand the concepts very well, I love physics and the math involved. but tryinh to translate the p5 version of the flocking system to phaser was way harder than I anticipaded. 

The process was the following: 

1. first I had to tranlate the object to a sprite, which is a game-object in phaser.
2. after that I had plan to make said object follow the game character. I had lot's of problems there.
3. Last, once the character was being followed by one object adding to that was going to be easy, due to phaser being very good at detecting other elements and such.
