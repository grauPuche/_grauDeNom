Week seven on Sound & Video, what a ride, I got in thinking I knew most of the stuff we were supposed to do but I ended up having problems at simple things like exporting of the file.Which mean that I’ve still had thing to learn.
<br><br>
Much was learnt on this last project, sound timing and being clear on what you want to say. Sound is a big part of a video, it has the same value as the images, and if you take from it, you need to add to the images, making them more expressive than they would normally do so it compensates the lack of expression on sound.
<br><br>
The main concept of the piece was creating a pseudo-video-tutorial that taking reference from what is considered the form of a bad YouTube tutorial, where the author has a lack of knowledge of video production and no equipment, therefore not having a voice over or a well produced and proper video.
<br><br>
From this place is where the errors in the video appear. Making it look like a rushed project made by a solo author in a cr@#py laptop. The kind of video you wonder its existence due to the carelessness of its production.
<br><br>
I’m proud of the whole piece, but specially of the little details that add realism and add to the sensation and concept that we looked for. But at the same time I’m happy of how great the acting was and the cinematography of the live-action shots.
<br><br>
The process we followed was mainly filming first the live action, and adapting the screen capture and the captions and others to the acting. Always following the initial storyboard to a certain extend.
