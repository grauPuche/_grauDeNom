				#7 LED's play<br><br>

Last weeks blogpost just in case you missed it: <a href="blog4_user.html"></a>
<br><br>
This week the assignment got real, we had to start coding and that's when I get nervous, when you combine physical technology with software commands, and I don't know that much of both subjects. I loose my temper, util I figure it out.
<br><br>
In this occasion I had to circuits, the first one was analog in & output where I control the LED's brightness through a potentiometer.
the coding part was tricky but with a little help we sorted it out.
<br><br>

<div class="blog_captionimg">analog circuit - potentiometer & LED in action</div> 
<br><br>
The second circuit was much more ambitious, I tried to create a game where the user hat to stop the moving light at the green LED. I started creating a row of 7 LEDs, one of them, the center one was the green LED. I connected all of them to the digital ports and with code I animated the light so they would move in my desired pattern.
<br><br>

<div class="blog_captionimg">digital circuit - pushbutton & LEDs</div> 
<br><br>
That first part was simple. After that I connected the pushbutton to a digital port and made it an input, I also took the line were current goes to the green LED and placed an other input so I could know when was current going to the light. Afterwards I created an if statement with the condition of just showing the the green LED lit, and then an else statement that would run the animation.
<br><br>
For some reason I do not know, this failed, and the circuit right now as a temporary action, just stops the animation and activated a different one just for the green LED.
<br><br>
The piece of public interaction that I chose was the card activated access that the city bank offices have when one needs to enter the ATM booth on weekends.
<br><br>

<br><br>
Before using it my assumption was that I needed to insert the card into the designated spot, but once I had to use it I realised that you needed to swipe it, this conflict was quite common between the users that tried to get inside the booth, it was easy to recognise the usual ones that have been there before form those who came to the booth for the first time, if they knew the system the access process was quick, but if it was a newcomer they would have the same problem I had, this is due to the fact that  the groove where you are supposed to pass the card through is not open from the bottom and top, therefore from far away it appears as a spot for inserting the card and not swiping it.
<br><br>
This issue is due to the shape of the groove and how similar it is o a different device used with the same object, this creates the exposed comflict.
